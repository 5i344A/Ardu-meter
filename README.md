# Ardu-meter
Arduino based powermeter to accurately measure power draw of circuits 

uses ina219 i2c compatible current sensor which uses a 0.1ohm shunt to measure current 

uses ssd1306 display to show the readings of VBUS, Current draw & Power draw in realtime 

use default i2c pins of the arduino
